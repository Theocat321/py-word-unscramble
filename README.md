# py-word-unscramble

Input a word that is all scrambled up and the program will tell you the original word


## The Idea

This idea came to mind when in a lesson and my teacher recognised that people can understand words when the first and last letters are correct for the word and the remaining letters are scrambled up. This made my think of teaching a computer to do this using ML. On reflection I thought a more useful version could be any scrambled word without the first and last letter being correct, just all scrambled up. The solution also doesnt require machine learning and I have two ideas on what to do
